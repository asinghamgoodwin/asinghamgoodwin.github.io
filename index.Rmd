# Hello! I'm Alicia.

I am an activist and public health researcher based in West Harlem, NYC. I am currently working as the policy advisor for [Kristin Richardson Jordan](https://kristinforharlem.com/), the democratic nominee for New York City Council District 9. (Read about her historic win in [The Nation](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kristin-richardson-jordan-city-council/)!). I am also a data analyst with [Kara Rudolph](https://kararudolph.github.io/) at Columbia researching medication-assisted opioid treatment programs.

My health research interests include gun violence prevention, alternatives to policing, gender-based violence, substance use, and the ways in which structural forces like racism and sexism impact our health.

My activisim is focused around housing, enviornmental justice, and public transit, and I also love [crafting](/projects.html) and [programming](https://recurse.com)!
