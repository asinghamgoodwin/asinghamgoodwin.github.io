# Hello! I'm Alicia.

I am an activist and public health researcher based in West Harlem, NYC.

My health research interests include gun violence prevention, alternatives to policing, gender-based violence, substance use, and the ways in which structural forces like racism and sexism impact our health.

My activisim is focused around housing, enviornmental justice, and public transit, and I also love [crafting](/projects.html) and [programming](https://recurse.com)!
